# InstantChef
An Android app that helps users find recipes containing at least 80% of the ingredients currently in their pantry.

# Scenario: You currently have eggs, salt, pepper, cheese, and spaghetti noodles in your kitchen.
What in the world can you make with all (or most of) these ingredients, without having to go to the store to pick up a bunch of extra items or surfing through hours through the web?

Introducing... InstantChef! (oooooh.)

InstantChef will allow users to build a digital pantry that represents the items currently in their kitchen. When the user has inputted all of their ingredients, they can then search for recipes (by cuisine and food category). The search will find all recipes in the database that require at least 80% of the ingredients that the user currently has. The user can "favorite" recipes they like (which will then be added to their personal "Recipe Bank"). The user can also create their own recipes to be added to the database, if they so wish.
